<br>
Dadra and Nagar Haveli and Daman and Diu is a union territory in India. The territory was constituted through the merger of the former territories of Dadra and Nagar Haveli and Daman and Diu. Plans for the proposed merger were announced by the Government of India in July 2019, the necessary legislation was passed in the Parliament of India in December 2019 and came into effect on 26 January 2020. The territory is made up of four separate geographical entities: Dadra, Nagar Haveli, Daman, and the island of Diu. All four areas were part of Portuguese Goa and Damaon with the former capital in Panaji, and came under Indian rule in the mid-20th century after the Annexation of Goa. These were jointly administered as Goa, Daman and Diu until 1987, when Goa was granted statehood after the Konkani language agitation. The capital city is Daman while Silvassa is the largest city.
